##What is Colorspread ?

Colorspread is a clone of the Color Fill and Fill Zone games. The aim of the game is to fill the board with a single color using the minimum number of 'swaps'. A swap consists in clicking a color in the rightmost part of the window. When doing this, the top-left square of the board and all the adjacent squares of the same color will change to that color. To win the game, one must fill the entire board with a single color in less that 22 swaps.
